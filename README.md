# overview

This document provides an overview of a Node.js application designed for handling user management and authentication. The application consists of two main modules:

User Module: Responsible for managing user-related operations.

Auth Module: Handles authentication processes.

Each module is organized into four components:

Model: Defines the structure and schema for data storage.

Middleware: Implements middleware functions for request handling.

Controller: Implements business logic and interacts with models.

Route: Defines API endpoints and connects them to corresponding controllers.

## Modules

### User Module

Model

User Model: Defines the schema for user data including fields such as username, email, password hash, etc.

Middleware

User Authentication Middleware: Middleware for authenticating user requests.

Controller

User Controller: Implements logic for user operations such as registration, login, profile update, etc.

Route

user Routes: Defines endpoints for user-related operations:

/api/v1/users : Get all users on the database

/api/v1/user/:id :Endpoint to get a user by id.

/api/v1/user/:id :Endpoint to delete a user by id.(DELETE)

/api/user/:id : Endpoint for retrieving and updating user profile (PUT)

### Auth Module

Model

Session Model: Defines the schema for storing session data including user tokens, expiry, etc.

Middleware

Authentication Middleware: Middleware for verifying user authentication tokens.

Controller

Auth Controller: Implements logic for authentication processes such as generating tokens, verifying credentials, etc.

Route

Auth Routes: Defines endpoints for authentication:

/api/auth/register: Endpoint to register user.

/api/auth/login: Endpoint to login user.

Dependencies
Express: Web framework for Node.js.

Mongoose: Object modeling tool for MongoDB.

Bcrypt: Library for hashing passwords.

Jsonwebtoken: Library for generating and verifying JSON web tokens.

#Usage

Install dependencies: npm install

Start the server: npm run dev

#Configuration

Environment Variables: Configure environment variables for database connection, server port, etc.

Database: Configure connection settings for MongoDB.

Testing

Unit Tests: Write unit tests for controllers, middleware, and models using testing frameworks like Mocha, Chai, etc.

Integration Tests: Test API endpoints and their functionality using tools like Postman, Newman, etc.

Security Considerations

Password Hashing: Ensure passwords are securely hashed before storing them in the database.

Authentication Tokens: Use JWTs with proper signing and validation to secure API endpoints.

Input Validation: Implement input validation to prevent injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.

Conclusion

This documentation provides an overview of a Node.js application for user management and authentication. By following this guide, developers can understand the structure, components, and usage of the application.
